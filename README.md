# Chat_Room
This is a personal project I decided to do to practice my Python a bit. I was able to develop a chatroom where people would be able to do simply that, chat with each other! It allowed for each person that connected to the server to be able to enter the name they wanted to go by, or their "nickname". This was developed using a local default IP address and host, which allows for the chat room to only operate on a local computer.
